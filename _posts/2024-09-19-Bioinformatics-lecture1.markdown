# 0. Introduction and Getting Started

> Bioinformatics: _Decode the Language of Life_

## 1. Introduction

### **4** steps of Bioinformatics:

* **Question**: Biological/Medical Knowledge
  * What is the universe made of?
  * <font color=red>What is the biological basis of consciousness?</font>
  * <font color=red>Why do humans have so few genes?</font>
  * <font color=red>To what extent are genetic variation and personal health linked?</font>
  * Can the laws of physics be unified?

* **Information**: Biological/Medical Data
  * Images
  * Sequences
    * _Moore's Law_ : Revolution of Sequencing Power
    * Type of <mark>NGS</mark> (Next Generation Sequencing)
      1. DNA-seq
      2. RNA-seq
      3. Epigenetics
         * DNAase
         * Methylation
         * Histone modifications: ChiP-seq
      4. Interaction
         * Protein-DNA: ChiP-seq
         * Protein-RNA: CLIP-seq
         * DNA-RNA: Grid-seq

* **Analysis**: Data Clean & Feature Extraction

>An **algorithm** and a **model** are both important concepts in computer science and machine learning, but they serve different purposes:
>
>1. **Algorithm**:
>   An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules used to solve a problem or perform a task. Itâ€™s a defined series of operations or instructions that can process data to produce an output. Algorithms are the logic or the processes behind a program.
>2. **Model**:
>   A model is the output or the representation that results from applying an algorithm to data. In machine learning, a model represents the learned patterns or relationships in data that are used to make predictions or decisions.
